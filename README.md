# mojn-ios 
*Meaning: Mojn [ˈmʌjn] means both hello and goodbye. It can be used at all times of a day.*

## Preliminary
Project is using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).
To fetch dependencies:

```sh
carthage update --platform ios
```

## Project
Should we start treating phone numbers like passwords? Maybe. I belive we should use different phone numbers for different situtations to stay more private and to secure our self against different scam techniques. We should have pseudonyms. One number for work, one number for dating, one number for family etc. 

This is not a brand new idea. There are plenty of other companies ([MySudo](https://mysudo.com/), [Hushed](https://hushed.com/) and [Burner](https://www.burnerapp.com/) to name a few) who solves this, however most (all?) are closed-source and often limited to certain countries.

This project aims to create a FOSS platform which will be self hostable. You will be able to create pseudonyms with different numbers and names and you will be able to message and call to and from the pseudonyms through the backend. The numbers will be handled by [Twilio](https://twilio.com/).

## Goal

The goal is to release this app on the AppStore. This way people can selfhost [the api](https://github.com/casperstorm/mojn-api/) and use either the AppStore version of this app, or build it them self.

## API
[mojn-api](https://github.com/casperstorm/mojn-api/).
